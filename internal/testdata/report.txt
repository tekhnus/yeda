 150 1045 / 1647 90.32% Seriously apprehending that his malady would increase, unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful, or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful (which would be better), I made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us.
 151 1050 / 1647 90.40% Dick anxiously watched us from his chair, we concocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day, with triumphant success.

 161 1109 / 1647 91.48% Micawber walked so erect before his fellow man, on the strength of this virtuous action, that his chest looked half as broad again when he lighted us downstairs.
 162 1113 / 1647 91.57% I certainly should not have had the moral courage to refuse it; and I have no doubt he knew that (to his credit be it written), quite as well as I did.
 163 1121 / 1647 91.70% Our residence at Canterbury, and our local connexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps.

 170 1158 / 1647 92.32% Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance, I made bold to open the gate, and walk after him, so as to meet him when he should turn round.
 171 1162 / 1647 92.40% Traddles, I wish to be as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance.
 172 1164 / 1647 92.47% Thomas Traddles was left—let me say, in short, in the lurch.

 178 1181 / 1647 92.82% ‘But these writings, you know, that I speak of, are already drawn up and finished,’ said Traddles after a little consideration.
 179 1184 / 1647 92.88% Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes, and that something really had turned up at last.
 180 1186 / 1647 92.94% ’  I expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction.

 188 1215 / 1647 93.48% On a table by the window in Buckingham Street, we set out the work Traddles procured for him—which was to make, I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way—and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial.
 189 1223 / 1647 93.61% Not satisfied with all these proceedings, but burning with impatience to do something more, I went to see Traddles, now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street, Holborn.
