  12   90 / 1642 51.25% But somebody is always being murdered, and I didnt read it.
  13   98 / 1642 52.39% said the Doctor,—which he had always made a very grave appeal to the honour of us boys.
  14  106 / 1642 53.51% We had not been seated long, when I saw an approaching arrival in Mrs.
  15  114 / 1642 54.50% Its very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but dont you think you could do better?

  17  130 / 1642 56.22% I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of Mr.
  18  138 / 1642 57.13% Then be it so, said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, and still keeping his hand there, as we still walked up and down.
  19  146 / 1642 57.85% Dick, who had been with me to Highgate twice already, and had resumed his companionship with the Doctor, I took with me.
  20  154 / 1642 58.54% Micawber, assuming a profound air, a judge, or even say a Chancellor.
  21  162 / 1642 59.35% She did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, or a very false one.
  22  170 / 1642 60.03% I got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already.
  23  177 / 1642 60.69% Theres a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder, observed Mr.
  24  185 / 1642 61.43% The Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change the subject, Then theres no news at all; and no news, they say, is good news.
  25  193 / 1642 62.05% Micawber—but glancing inquisitively at Traddles, too; we have time enough before us, for the consideration of those questions.
  26  201 / 1642 62.63% I wondered then, whether she would have gone if Agnes had not been in town, and whether Agnes had some good influence over her too!
  27  207 / 1642 63.18% Micawber, though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony, I never will!
  28  213 / 1642 63.70% I stimulated myself into such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I had been earning I dont know how much.
  29  221 / 1642 64.23% I also became once more known to his sister, Miss Micawber, in whom, as Mr.

  33  249 / 1642 66.75% We were to work two hours every morning, and two or three hours every night, except on Saturdays, when I was to rest.
  34  257 / 1642 67.27% I hardly ever take breakfast, sir, he replied, with his head thrown back in an easy-chair.
  35  263 / 1642 67.75% But, my good young friend, whats seventy pounds a year?
  36  271 / 1642 68.21% Traddles imitated me in the first particular, but did not consider himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second.
  37  279 / 1642 68.62% What I had to do, was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with a resolute and steady heart.
  38  287 / 1642 69.07% The Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife, turned to her and said:  You must go, Annie.
  39  295 / 1642 69.46% Micawber, myself, and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes.

  45  342 / 1642 71.71% Thomas Traddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent.
  46  349 / 1642 72.01% Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor took me into the house to present me to Mrs.
  47  357 / 1642 72.45% My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation, was to find the Doctors house.
  48  365 / 1642 72.78% Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual recognition.

  50  377 / 1642 73.54% What I had to do, was, to take my woodmans axe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora.
  51  385 / 1642 73.83% Markleham, said the Doctor, was quite vexed about him, poor thing; so we have got him at home again; and we have bought him a little Patent place, which agrees with him much better.
  52  391 / 1642 74.10% Dick professed an absolute certainty of having seen him before, and we both said, Very likely.
  53  399 / 1642 74.45% Certainly, your having a profession, and being actually engaged in studying it, makes a difference.
  54  406 / 1642 74.71% If you will take such time as I have, and that is my mornings and evenings, and can think it worth seventy pounds a year, you will do me such a service as I cannot express.
  55  412 / 1642 74.97% It really, said Traddles, suddenly, taking a letter out of his pocket, and giving it to me, put Mr.
  56  420 / 1642 75.28% Traddles having mentioned newspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things together, and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I could qualify myself for this pursuit.
  57  428 / 1642 75.59% The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that wonderful performance, and we settled to begin next morning at seven oclock.
  58  436 / 1642 75.88% Learning from Traddles that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away, I expressed my readiness to do honour to it; and we went off together to the lodging which Mr.
  59  444 / 1642 76.16% She had not, but had sent into London to put her cousin off; and had gone out in the afternoon to see Agnes, and had prevailed upon the Doctor to go with her; and they had walked home by the fields, the Doctor told me, the evening being delightful.
  60  452 / 1642 76.42% Without looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked me about Agnes, and whether she should see her, and whether she was not likely to come that day; and was so much disturbed, that I wondered how even the Doctor, buttering his toast, could be blind to what was so obvious.
  61  460 / 1642 76.68% Micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the communications he writes.
  62  468 / 1642 76.93% And I shall be twenty times happier, sir, said I, with a little—I hope innocent—flattery, if my employment is to be on the Dictionary.
  63  476 / 1642 77.18% Micawber, that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers; and I am also aware that the various members of my family, to whom Mr.
  64  483 / 1642 77.41% Not that I mean to say its rigidly limited to seventy pounds a-year, because I have always contemplated making any young friend I might thus employ, a present too.

  66  499 / 1642 77.91% for forty-one, ten, eleven and a half, and I am happy to recover my moral dignity, and to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man!
  67  507 / 1642 78.13% Jack Maldon shook hands with me; but not very warmly, I believed; and with an air of languid patronage, at which I secretly took great umbrage.
  68  515 / 1642 78.36% Micawber to fill us bumpers, and proposed the toast in due form: shaking hands with him across the table, and kissing Mrs.
  69  523 / 1642 78.60% I was in a state of ferocious virtue, however, as to young men who were not cutting down trees in the forest of difficulty; and my impression must be received with due allowance.
  70  531 / 1642 78.81% Micawber had prepared, in a wash-hand-stand jug, what he called a Brew of the agreeable beverage for which he was famous.
  71  538 / 1642 79.02% The church with the slender spire, that stands on the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time.
  72  544 / 1642 79.22% Micawber could not be a barrister, without being entered at an inn of court as a student, for five years.
  73  552 / 1642 79.51% The resources of this lodging were so limited, that we found the twins, now some eight or nine years old, reposing in a turn-up bedstead in the family sitting-room, where Mr.
  74  559 / 1642 79.71% I cannot express how extremely delighted they both were, by the idea of my aunts being in difficulties; and how comfortable and friendly it made them.
  75  567 / 1642 79.92% On Monday next, on the arrival of the four oclock afternoon coach at Canterbury, my foot will be on my native heath—my name, Micawber!
  76  573 / 1642 80.10% I often glanced at it, for she sat in the window all the time we were at work; and made our breakfast, which we took by snatches as we were employed.
  77  579 / 1642 80.29% Micawber coughed, and drank his punch with an air of exceeding satisfaction—still glancing at Traddles, as if he desired to have his opinion.
  78  585 / 1642 80.48% It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence, Mr.
  79  592 / 1642 80.66% My dear tutor, said I (now, really, without any nonsense), to whom I owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge—  No, no, interposed the Doctor.
  80  600 / 1642 80.86% In this condition, he felt more incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever; and the harder he worked at it, the oftener that unlucky head of King Charles the First got into it.
  81  608 / 1642 81.10% Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had before him, without the least departure from the original; and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the First, he should fly to the Memorial.
  82  616 / 1642 81.28% I have seen it displayed with such success, that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars.
  83  621 / 1642 81.45% Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes, and that something really had turned up at last.
  84  628 / 1642 81.63% Does an individual place himself beyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as Mr.
  85  634 / 1642 81.80% Micawber possesses what I have heard my papa call, when I lived at home, the judicial mind; and I hope Mr.
  86  642 / 1642 82.02% The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this,—I had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in Parliament.
  87  650 / 1642 82.19% Micawber was, I was probably indebted to some compassionate recollection he retained of me as his boy-lodger, for never having been asked by him for money.
  88  657 / 1642 82.35% I came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that part of the neighbourhood, and wishing I had not gone near it, strolled about until it was ten oclock.
  89  665 / 1642 82.56% When we were nearly come to the last round of the punch, I addressed myself to Traddles, and reminded him that we must not separate, without wishing our friends health, happiness, and success in their new career.
  90  673 / 1642 82.76% Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles, I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me.
  91  681 / 1642 82.95% He had his old companions about him, too; for there were plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood, and two or three rooks were on the grass, looking after him, as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks, and were observing him closely in consequence.
  92  689 / 1642 83.12% When he did, and came towards me, he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently without thinking about me at all; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure, and he took me by both hands.
  93  697 / 1642 83.28% There was a softened shade upon her face, thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room; and I thought all the way to Doctors Commons, of the night when I had seen it looking at him as he read.
  94  702 / 1642 83.44% Micawber told us, her mother renewed her youth, like the Phoenix.
  95  710 / 1642 83.60% Copperfield, in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law, place it out of his power to rise, ultimately, to the top of the tree.
  96  717 / 1642 83.76% Micawber carefully referred to papers, was, I believe, twenty-three, four, nine and a half, of the second, according to my entry of that transaction, eighteen, six, two.
  97  724 / 1642 83.90% Before we went, I wrote Traddles a full statement of all that had happened, and Traddles wrote me back a capital answer, expressive of his sympathy and friendship.
  98  728 / 1642 84.05% Micawbers eye, feelingly acquiesced.
  99  735 / 1642 84.19% I may augur, from the silence of my family, that they object to the resolution I have taken; but I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty, Mr.
 100  743 / 1642 84.34% In fact, my dear Copperfield, I have entered into arrangements, by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our friend Heep, to assist and serve him in the capacity of—and to be—his confidential clerk.
 101  749 / 1642 84.48% I am bound to state to you, he said, with an official air, that the business habits, and the prudent suggestions, of Mrs.
 102  757 / 1642 84.63% He passed his hand complacently over his bald head, and said with ostentatious resignation:  My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune.
 103  765 / 1642 84.77% After many compliments on this performance, we fell into some general conversation; and as I was too full of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself, I made them known to Mr.
 104  773 / 1642 84.92% Thomas Traddles has, on two several occasions, put his name, if I may use a common expression, to bills of exchange for my accommodation.
 105  777 / 1642 85.05% Steerforths, and looked over the corner of the garden wall.
 106  785 / 1642 85.18% She gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track, and wearing its heart out.
 107  791 / 1642 85.31% An old red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at, as I recollect it.
 108  797 / 1642 85.44% Moreover, he said, he wanted to hear her sing all the new singers songs to him; and how could she do that well, unless she went?
 109  805 / 1642 85.57% We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers, refreshed by the sight of the flower-pot stand and the little round table in a corner of the small apartment.
 110  813 / 1642 85.70% Glancing round as I made a suitable reply, I observed that the family effects were already packed, and that the amount of luggage was by no means overwhelming.
 111  818 / 1642 85.83% Micawber, who is a man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to speak with all possible respect.
 112  826 / 1642 85.96% Micawber, rising with one of his thumbs in each of his waistcoat pockets, the companion of my youth: if I may be allowed the expression—and my esteemed friend Traddles: if I may be permitted to call him so—will allow me, on the part of Mrs.
 113  834 / 1642 86.09% Strong, whom we found in the Doctors new study, dusting his books,—a freedom which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favourites.
 114  840 / 1642 86.22% He then said with much solemnity:  One thing more I have to do, before this separation is complete, and that is to perform an act of justice.
 115  848 / 1642 86.40% When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a different errand from that old one of pleasure, with which it was associated, it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life.
 116  856 / 1642 86.54% You are bound, in justice to your family, if not to yourself, to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you.
 117  862 / 1642 86.66% I began the next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and then started for Highgate.
 118  867 / 1642 86.77% In this state, I went into a cottage that I saw was to let, and examined it narrowly,—for I felt it necessary to be practical.
 119  875 / 1642 86.89% It would do for me and Dora admirably: with a little front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at the tradespeople through the railings, and a capital room upstairs for my aunt.
 120  881 / 1642 87.01% Perhaps it impressed me the more then, because it was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of, or to strengthen my confidence in, Mr.
 121  885 / 1642 87.12% Dear me, said Traddles, opening his eyes, I had no idea you were such a determined character, Copperfield!

 123  897 / 1642 87.35% In bidding adieu to the modern Babylon, where we have undergone many vicissitudes, I trust not ignobly, Mrs.
 124  903 / 1642 87.47% Thomas Traddles, to our present abode, and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion, you will confer a Boon  On                         One                     Who               Is             Ever yours,         WILKINS MICAWBER.
 125  905 / 1642 87.59% )  —Has nothing, pursued Traddles, to do with that.
 126  911 / 1642 87.70% These sums, united, make a total, if my calculation is correct, amounting to forty-one, ten, eleven and a half.
 127  913 / 1642 87.80% Oh dear, yes!
 128  920 / 1642 87.91% You have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon; and is it not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I can offer?
 129  925 / 1642 88.01% Theres an account about the people being hungry and discontented down in the North, but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere.
 130  930 / 1642 88.11% This concluded, he went to his Patent place, I suppose; but at all events went away on his horse, looking very idle.
 131  935 / 1642 88.21% When I left, at nine oclock, she was kneeling on the ground at the Doctors feet, putting on his shoes and gaiters for him.
 132  937 / 1642 88.31% Ill begin tomorrow.
 133  945 / 1642 88.50% Ill buy a book, said I, with a good scheme of this art in it; Ill work at it at the Commons, where I havent half enough to do; Ill take down the speeches in our court for practice—Traddles, my dear fellow, Ill master it!
 134  949 / 1642 88.60% Traddles—if I could beat a drum—or blow anything!
 135  957 / 1642 88.75% I had a good mind to ask an old man, in wire spectacles, who was breaking stones upon the road, to lend me his hammer for a little while, and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite.
 136  963 / 1642 88.85% Micawber and myself cannot disguise from our minds that we part, it may be for years and it may be for ever, with an individual linked by strong associations to the altar of our domestic life.
 137  969 / 1642 88.95% I read the service over with a flat-candle on the previous night, and the conclusion I derived from it was, that I never could desert Mr.
 138  974 / 1642 89.05% Micawber, to immure ones-self in a Cathedral town; but surely, Mr.
 139  982 / 1642 89.18% Our residence at Canterbury, and our local connexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps.
 140  988 / 1642 89.28% If I am reserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally, in allusion to his baldness, for that distinction.
 141  995 / 1642 89.39% All I have to say on that score is, that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene, and the God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops.
 142  999 / 1642 89.47% My whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed.
 143 1004 / 1642 89.56% Besides which, she is so charmingly ugly, relapsing into languor.
 144 1010 / 1642 89.65% But I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged, and never walked slowly on any account, and felt enthusiastically that the more I tired myself, the more I was doing to deserve Dora.
 145 1014 / 1642 89.73% Traddles looked astonished, as he well might; but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous condition.
 146 1022 / 1642 89.86% I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora yet, because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days, and I deferred all I had to tell her until then; merely informing her in my letters (all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills), that I had much to tell her.
 147 1027 / 1642 89.95% Dick in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles, and sucking his thumb.
 148 1035 / 1642 90.11% Seriously apprehending that his malady would increase, unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful, or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful (which would be better), I made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us.
 149 1040 / 1642 90.20% Micawber forfeits no privilege by entering on these duties, my anxiety is set at rest.
 150 1045 / 1642 90.28% Micawber is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself, and take a commanding station.
 151 1050 / 1642 90.37% It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to educate my son for the Church; I will not deny that I should be happy, on his account, to attain to eminence.

 161 1104 / 1642 91.39% When I approached the Doctors cottage—a pretty old place, on which he seemed to have expended some money, if I might judge from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completed—I saw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters and all, as if he had never left off walking since the days of my pupilage.
 162 1112 / 1642 91.53% A display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was not supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that time, I think, as I have observed it to be considered since.
