</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 10 </h4>
<p> We exhorted him to be resolute in this, and left my aunt to observe him. </p>

</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 11 </h4>
<p> And I went on at a mighty rate, as if it could be done by walking. </p>

<div class="card">
<h4> 13 </h4>
<p> said the Doctor,—which he had always made a very grave appeal to the honour of us boys. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">

<p> We had not been seated long, when I saw an approaching arrival in Mrs. </p>

<p> Its very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but dont you think you could do better? </p>

<div class="card">
<h4> 16 </h4>
<p> I have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all others. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">

<p> I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of Mr. </p>

<p> She did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, or a very false one. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 22 </h4>
<p> I got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 23 </h4>
<p> Theres a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder, observed Mr. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 24 </h4>
<p> The Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change the subject, Then theres no news at all; and no news, they say, is good news. </p>
<hr>

<div class="card">
<h4> 25 </h4>
<p> Micawber—but glancing inquisitively at Traddles, too; we have time enough before us, for the consideration of those questions. </p>
<hr>

<p> I wondered then, whether she would have gone if Agnes had not been in town, and whether Agnes had some good influence over her too! </p>

<p> Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 31 </h4>
<p> Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do, and which was pretty well paid. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">

<p> I was pretty busy now; up at five in the morning, and home at nine or ten at night. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 33 </h4>
<p> We were to work two hours every morning, and two or three hours every night, except on Saturdays, when I was to rest. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 34 </h4>
<p> I hardly ever take breakfast, sir, he replied, with his head thrown back in an easy-chair. </p>
<hr>

<p> But, my good young friend, whats seventy pounds a year? </p>

<h4> 36 </h4>
<p> Traddles imitated me in the first particular, but did not consider himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second. </p>

<p> What I had to do, was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with a resolute and steady heart. </p>

<h4> 38 </h4>
<p> The Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife, turned to her and said:  You must go, Annie. </p>

<div class="card">

<p> Micawber, myself, and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes. </p>

<div class="card">
<h4> 41 </h4>
<p> These observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations made that evening, were interrupted by Mrs. </p>

</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 42 </h4>
<p> I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty, under circumstances that should prove my strength. </p>

<h4> 43 </h4>
<p> Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter) was addressed to me, By the kindness of T. </p>

<p> Traddles, of the obligation which I took upon myself when I repeated the irrevocable words, I, Emma, take thee, Wilkins. </p>

<p> Thomas Traddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent. </p>

<div class="card">
<h4> 46 </h4>
<p> Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor took me into the house to present me to Mrs. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 47 </h4>
<p> My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation, was to find the Doctors house. </p>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h4> 48 </h4>
<p> Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual recognition. </p>

<p> With the new life, came new purpose, new intention. </p>
